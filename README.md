## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Optional:

```bash
npm run dev:3005
```

If your dev server gets into a bad `.next` state (missing manifests, `_document.js`, etc):

```bash
npm run dev:clean
```
